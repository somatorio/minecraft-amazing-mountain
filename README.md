# Amazing Mountain

This is just a map i'm playing and decided to share it with git, so other people can "play along" in a offline way

## How can i play along you?
Just clone this repo (with `git clone git@github.com:somatorio/minecraft-amazing_mountain.git "Amazing mountain"`) inside your minecraft saves dir and play :) (dont forget to send PRs with your modifications and to keep your clone updated ;p)
